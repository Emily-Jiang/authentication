5 Executing Tests
-----------------

The {TechnologyShortName} TCK uses the JUnit and Maven Surefire harness to execute the tests in the test suite.

This chapter includes the following topics:

* link:#GBFUZ[Starting the tests]
* link:#GBFWM[Running a Subset of the Tests]
* link:#GCLRR[Running the TCK Against your selected CI]
* link:#GCLRZ[Running the TCK Against a Vendor's Implementation]
* link:#GBFVK[Test Reports]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The instructions in this chapter assume that you have installed and
configured your test environment as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation,"] and
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration,"],
respectively.

=======================================================================

ifdef::rebuild[]
As explained in link:rebuild.html#GCLIZ[Appendix B, "Packaging the
Test Applications in Servlet-Compliant WAR
Files With VI-Specific Information,"] the {TechnologyShortName} TCK
introduces the concept of repackaging the TCK tests.
