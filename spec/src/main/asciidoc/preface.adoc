== Preface

This document is the Jakarta Authentication Specification, version 3.1.

=== Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC2119]].

=== Audience

This document is intended for developers of
a Compatible Implementation and of the Technology Compatibility Kit and
for those who will be delivering implementations of this technology in
their products.

=== Specification Scope

Jakarta Authentication defines a general low-level SPI for authentication mechanisms, which are controllers
that interact with a caller and a container's environment to obtain the caller's credentials, validate these,
and pass an authenticated identity (such as name and groups) to the container. 
        
Jakarta Authentication consists of several profiles, with each profile telling how a specific container
(such as Jakarta Servlet) can integrate with- and adapt to this SPI.

=== Abstract

This specification defines a service provider
interface (SPI) by which authentication providers implementing message
authentication mechanisms may be integrated in client or server message
processing containers or runtimes. Authentication providers integrated
through this interface operate on network messages provided to them by
their calling container. They transform outgoing messages such that the
source of the message may be authenticated by the receiving container,
and the recipient of the message may be authenticated by the message
sender. They authenticate incoming messages and return to their calling
container the identity established as a result of the message
authentication. The SPI is applicable to diverse messaging protocols
(including SOAP, Jakarta Messaging, and HTTP) and message processing runtimes
(including Jakarta EE containers).

This specification extends the pluggable
authentication concepts of the Java Authentication and Authorization
Service (JAAS) to the authentication of network messages. This effect is
achieved by evolving the JAAS login model to facilitate the integration
of security functionality at differentiated points within a logical
message processing model and by defining corresponding authentication
interfaces that make the network messages available for processing by
authentication modules.
